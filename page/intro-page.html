    <h1>Department of Software Engineering</h2>
        <h3>A brief introduction</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <h4>Faculty</h4>
        <div>
            <p>The department of Software Engineering has a faculty of committed professionals including three associated professors.
                Ten of the faculty obtained their PhD degree in countries such as Germany, Hungary, Norway, Japan, and France.
                They bring to the department not only scientific knowledge but also professionalism learned from international
                environment. The department is also home to about ten doctoral candidates in Software Engineering.</p>
            <p>At undergraduate level, apart from core courses such as Object-oriented Programming and Software Engineering,
                the department staff also provide advanced courses with knowledge and skills required for professionals in
                software engineering: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Software Testing and Quality Assurance, Software
                Project Management, User Interface Design, Software Architecture, Formal Methods, Embedded programming and
                real-time systems Functional Programming, â€¦</p>
            <p>At postgraduate level, the department provides courses that extend undergraduate level as well as courses that
                are research-oriented or industry-oriented students.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Main research interests</h4>
        <div>
            <p>Our faculty members are active in the following topics: automated testing, software specification and verification,
                software architecure, program analysis, SMT solvers, domain specific language, realtime and embedded systems,
                modern software process, and formal methods in general.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>Our current objectives are:</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase the number of research papers published, especially in highly recognized journals and international
                    conferences.</li>
                <li>Research groups on application areas such as tools and software processes, solving real-world problems that
                    can be directly applied to the IT industry.</li>
                <li>Continue improving and adapting teaching method and materials in order to increase professionalism and competiveness
                    of graduates.</li>
                <li>Build research labs in software engineering.</li>
            </ul>
